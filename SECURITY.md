# Security guide

## How to report a vulnerability

### Deciding its importance and where to report

1. It's threatening other users to a degree that it could impact them heavily
Please report the issue via the [issues tab](https://github.com/AlexDeFoc/gw_log_sys/issues) and attach to it the "security issue" **label**

2. It's breaking other features or functionality of the program/library to a degree it needs attention/addressing or fixing
Please report the issue via the [discussions tab](https://github.com/AlexDeFoc/gw_log_sys/discussions) first and if it has
been decided by the devs that is important enough to need involvement to the code, and your particular issue wasn't fixed, you can
follow up with an issue via the [issues tab](https://github.com/AlexDeFoc/gw_log_sys/issues) and attaching to it the "bug" **label** or the "problem" **label**
